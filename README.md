# Art Gallery Website Design Readme

Description
This README provides a guide for designing an art gallery website using HTML and CSS. An art gallery website is a visually rich platform that showcases artworks, provides information about artists, and engages art enthusiasts. 

Design and Implementation
The art gallery website was designed using VScode and was deployed by hosting it on a web server. The website was made responsive by using CSS media queries to adapt to different screen sizes. Test your website in various web browsers and on different devices to ensure it looks and functions as expected.
